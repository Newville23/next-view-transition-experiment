    description:
      "<span><div><p>Recent breakthroughs in AI have not only increased demand for AI products, they've also lowered the barriers to entry for those who want to build AI products. The model-as-a-service approach has transformed AI from an esoteric discipline into a powerful development tool that anyone can use. Everyone, including those with minimal or no prior AI experience, can now leverage AI models to build applications. In this book, author Chip Huyen discusses AI engineering: the process of building applications with readily available foundation models.  \n</p><p>\nThe book starts with an overview of AI engineering, explaining how it differs from traditional ML engineering and discussing the new AI stack. The more AI is used, the more opportunities there are for catastrophic failures, and therefore, the more important evaluation becomes. This book discusses different approaches to evaluating open-ended models, including the rapidly growing AI-as-a-judge approach.\n</p><p>\nAI application developers will discover how to navigate the AI landscape, including models, datasets, evaluation benchmarks, and the seemingly infinite number of use cases and application patterns. You'll learn a framework for developing an AI application, starting with simple techniques and progressing toward more sophisticated methods, and discover how to efficiently deploy these applications.\n</p><ul><li>Understand what AI engineering is and how it differs from traditional machine learning engineering \n</li><li>Learn the process for developing an AI application, the challenges at each step, and approaches to address them \n</li><li>Explore various model adaptation techniques, including prompt engineering, RAG, fine-tuning, agents, and dataset engineering, and understand how and why they work\n</li><li>Examine the bottlenecks for latency and cost when serving foundation models and learn how to overcome them\n</li><li>Choose the right model, dataset, evaluation benchmarks, and metrics for your needs\n</li></ul><p>Chip Huyen works to accelerate data analytics on GPUs at Voltron Data. Previously, she was with Snorkel AI and NVIDIA, founded an AI infrastructure startup, and taught Machine Learning Systems Design at Stanford. She's the author of the book Designing Machine Learning Systems, an Amazon bestseller in AI.\n</p><p><em>AI Engineering</em> builds upon and is complementary to <em>Designing Machine Learning Systems (O'Reilly)</em>.</p></div></span>",

      '<span><b>Learn how to create, train, and tweak large language models (LLMs) by building one from the ground up!</b><br/>\n\nIn <i>Build a Large Language Model (from Scratch)</i> bestselling author Sebastian Raschka guides you step by step through creating your own LLM. Each stage is explained with clear text, diagrams, and examples. You’ll go from the initial design and creation, to pretraining on a general corpus, and on to fine-tuning for specific tasks.<br/><br/>\n<i>Build a Large Language Model (from Scratch)</i> teaches you how to:<br/><br/>\n<ul><li>Plan and code all the parts of an LLM</li><li>Prepare a dataset suitable for LLM training</li><li>Fine-tune LLMs for text classification and with your own data</li><li>Use human feedback to ensure your LLM follows instructions</li><li>Load pretrained weights into an LLM</li></ul><br/>\n<i>Build a Large Language Model (from Scratch)</i> takes you inside the AI black box to tinker with the internal systems that power generative AI. As you work through each key stage of LLM creation, you’ll develop an in-depth understanding of how LLMs work, their limitations, and their customization methods. Your LLM can be developed on an ordinary laptop, and used as your own personal assistant.<br/><br/><b>About the Technology</b><br/>Physicist Richard P. Feynman reportedly said, “I don’t understand anything I can’t build.” Based on this same powerful principle, bestselling author Sebastian Raschka guides you step by step as you build a GPT-style LLM that you can run on your laptop. This is an engaging book that covers each stage of the process, from planning and coding to training and fine-tuning.<br/><br/><b>About the Book</b><br/><i>Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)</i> is a practical and eminently-satisfying hands-on journey into the foundations of generative AI. Without relying on any existing LLM libraries, you’ll code a base model, evolve it into a text classifier, and ultimately create a chatbot that can follow your conversational instructions. And you’ll really understand it because you built it yourself!<br/><br/>\n\nFor deeper understanding and better learning we provide a built-in testing system into liveBook, the online version of this book. Separately, you can download a free PDF Test Yourself guide on this book from <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/test-yourself-on-build-a-large-language-model-from-scratch" target="_blank">here.</a><br/><br/><b>What\'s Inside</b><br/><ul><li>Plan and code an LLM comparable to GPT-2</li><li>Load pretrained weights</li><li>Construct a complete training pipeline</li><li>Fine-tune your LLM for text classification</li><li>Develop LLMs that follow human instructions</li></ul><br/><br/><b>About the Reader</b><br/>Readers need intermediate Python skills and some knowledge of machine learning. The LLM you create will run on any modern laptop and can optionally utilize GPUs.<br/><br/><b>About the Author</b><br/><b>Sebastian Raschka</b>, PhD, is an LLM Research Engineer with over a decade of experience in artificial intelligence. His work spans industry  and academia, including implementing LLM solutions as a senior engineer at Lightning AI and teaching as a statistics professor at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.<br/><br/>\n\nSebastian collaborates with Fortune 500 companies on AI solutions and serves on the Open Source Board at University of Wisconsin–Madison. He specializes in LLMs and the development of high-performance AI systems, with a deep focus on practical, code-driven implementations.
